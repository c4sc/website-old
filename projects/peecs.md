### Introduction

Public Entrance Exam Coaching Scheme was envisioned as a video learning platform to bridge the gap between the performance of students in government schools in their board exams and their success at various college entrance exams.

IT@Schools VICTERS channel provides  educational video content covering all the +1 and +2 school curriculum. This material has been uploaded and made available online. The PEECS site integrates these videos along with sample tests and exams to help students perform better at entrance examinations.
