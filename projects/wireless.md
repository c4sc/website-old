# Background

## Story
ISRO (Indian Space Research Organization)'s [Village Resource Centre](http://www.isro.gov.in/applications/village-resource-centre) project in collaboration with the Government of India to bring connectivity to remote parts of India using space based communication services. Each Village Resource Centre was equipped with high-quality audio/visual systems to allow for the delivery of services such as tele-education, tele-medicine, training and others.

After facing bandwidth issues the VRC project tried other means of connectivity including terrestrial cable. But due to issues like terrain they were unable to find stable connectivity. C4S proposed connecting the VRCs using open radio spectrum wireless connectivity.

## Project Scope
As the project progressed a number of local government bodies, schools, co-operatives and others expressed interest in connectivity.

The scope of the project grew and finally covered connectivity to the following:

* District Civil Station/Collectorate
* Local Bodies - 33
* Village Resource Centres - 5
* Milk Cooperatives - 12
* NIC District Centre

__Connected points__: 55

__Area covered__: 2131 sq. km.
