# About Us

Centre for Social Computing & Information Society (C4S) is a non-profit society that takes a inter-disciplinary approach to enable change and social development using Information and Communication Technology. The hyper networked global village is over loaded with resources and solutions while our real local village is still 'out of coverage area'.

Our simple mission is to bring these technologies and solutions to local communities,   allowing them to create their own knowledge economies and enabling them to connect on their own terms with the world at large.
